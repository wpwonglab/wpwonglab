- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, we are the Wong Lab at Harvard University, Boston Children's Hospital, and the Wyss institute  
- Our group investigates how biological systems work at the nanoscale, and the physical laws that govern their behavior. We are particularly interested in how mechanical forces regulate biological processes ranging from hearing to bleeding. We developing and applying novel methods in single-molecule andnanoscale biophysics to  accomplish this, combing approaches from fields ranging from molecular biology to optics.
